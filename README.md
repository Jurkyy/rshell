# My Homemade Rust Shell

Welcome to my homemade shell, a command-line interface (CLI) program built with Rust. Inspired by the mysterious black box of hackers, each line in the shell is adorned with a delightful :fire: emoji because it's just that cool.

Features:
- Re-implements basic commands like `exit`, `cd`, and `echo`
- Supports custom commands, including `rcat`
- Passes any undefined command to the underlying terminal for execution

You can find the source code and more information in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jurkyy/rshell).
